# FafnirDT: Dynamic Timestamp in Lock-based Concurrency Control Protocols onto Analysis System CCBench

## Description
Improved the performance of Two-Phase Locking with Starvation Freedom (2PLSF) under conditions of high resource contention during parallel execution. Integrated an elastic reader-writer lock with a dynamic timestamp tracker, enabling 2PLSF to operate effectively even in rare scenarios where it might otherwise experience zero transactions per second.<br>
