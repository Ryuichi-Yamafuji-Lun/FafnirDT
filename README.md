# FafnirDT: Dynamic Timestamp in Lock-based Concurrency Control Protocols

## ðŸ§  Overview

**FafnirDT** extends the **2PLSF (Two-Phase Locking with Starvation Freedom)** protocol to fix a critical scalability flaw in lock-based concurrency:

> When all available threads are occupied by long transactions, 2PLSF can enter a state of **zero throughput** â€” no new transactions can be scheduled.

FafnirDT introduces:
- A **Dynamic Timestamp Tracker**
- **Elastic arrays** for announce timestamps and read indicators
- A dedicated **monitoring thread** that injects new thread slots dynamically when delays are detected

âœ… Preserves serializability  
âœ… Maintains starvation freedom  
âœ… Recovers throughput under pathological workloads

---

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

**Problem:** 2PLSF uses a fixed-size metadata array tied to CPU core count. If all threads are running long transactions, short transactions must wait â€” resulting in **0 TPS** even when they could execute.

**FafnirDT** solves this by:
- Monitoring global delay using a timer
- Dynamically expanding metadata arrays
- Injecting additional threads into the protocol, bypassing lockout

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

| Scenario                                      | 2PLSF Throughput         | FafnirDT Throughput       | Notes                                                      |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Normal Workload** (short-only txns)        | 1.000x                    | **0.9535x**                | FafnirDT incurs ~4.65% overhead vs. 2PLSF                   |
| **Delayed Threads** (10 sec long txns)       | **0 TPS**                 | **~3,700 TPS**             | 2PLSF starves; FafnirDT sustains execution                 |
| **Thread Scaling (8 â†’ 64)** under delay      | N/A (0 TPS base)          | **~6,100 TPS â†’ ~3,700 TPS** | FafnirDT degrades ~39.45%, but throughput remains >0 TPS  |

âœ… FafnirDT eliminates starvation  
âœ… Graceful degradation when scaling under contention  
âœ… Minimal overhead in low-contention scenarios

## âœ… TL;DR

**FafnirDT** is a systems-level enhancement to 2PLSF that dynamically injects threads and timestamps to restore throughput when all original threads are blocked by long transactions. It demonstrates:  
- Performance where 2PLSF yields zero  
- Elastic scalability on multicore systems  
- Minimal trade-offs under normal workloads
