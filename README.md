# FafnirDT: Dynamic Timestamp in Lock-based Concurrency Control Protocols

## ðŸ§  Overview

**FafnirDT** extends the **2PLSF (Two-Phase Locking with Starvation Freedom)** protocol to fix a critical scalability flaw in lock-based concurrency:

> When all available threads are occupied by long transactions, 2PLSF can enter a state of **zero throughput** â€” no new transactions can be scheduled.

FafnirDT introduces:
- A **Dynamic Timestamp Tracker**
- **Elastic arrays** for announce timestamps and read indicators
- A dedicated **monitoring thread** that injects new thread slots dynamically when delays are detected

âœ… Preserves serializability  
âœ… Maintains starvation freedom  
âœ… Recovers throughput under pathological workloads

---

## ðŸ’¡ Motivation

**Problem:** 2PLSF uses a fixed-size metadata array tied to CPU core count. If all threads are running long transactions, short transactions must wait â€” resulting in **0 TPS** even when they could execute.

**FafnirDT** solves this by:
- Monitoring global delay using a timer
- Dynamically expanding metadata arrays
- Injecting additional threads into the protocol, bypassing lockout

## ðŸ“ˆ Key Results

| Scenario                                  | 2PLSF Throughput | FafnirDT Throughput     | Notes                                                               |
|------------------------------------------|------------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Normal Workload** (short-only txns)    | ~470K TPS        | **~450K TPS**            | ~4.65% overhead vs. 2PLSF                                           |
| **Delayed Threads** (10s long txns)      | **0 TPS**        | **~500Kâ€“610K TPS**       | 2PLSF stalls; FafnirDT sustains full throughput                     |
| **Thread Scaling (8 â†’ 64)** under delay  | **0 TPS**        | **~610K â†’ ~370K TPS**    | Throughput degrades ~39.45%, but remains operational                |

## âœ… TL;DR

**FafnirDT** is a systems-level enhancement to 2PLSF that dynamically injects threads and timestamps to restore throughput when all original threads are blocked by long transactions. It demonstrates:  
- Performance where 2PLSF yields zero  
- Elastic scalability on multicore systems  
- Minimal trade-offs under normal workloads
